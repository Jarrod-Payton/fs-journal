## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

converting an image to a link then using that http link to get images so you didn't have to wait for a round trip delivery

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Increases image size

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

because we don't have to seriously worry about the bandwidth being used and we don't want images to be super condensed and or super big
