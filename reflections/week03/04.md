3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

the template is set up to help us with basic setup to save us a little bit of time, it is also a great reference for importing and exporting across the dom, the template is set up to allow for "anonymous" use of functions and data using the ProxyState which makes it so you cannot see the information not meant to be seen from the display given to users.
