# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I was feeling totally lost on Monday and Tuesday but by the end of Wednesday I was feeling like a million bucks, I now feel like I have JavaScript understood and functions down well, I feel very confident and feel as though I might actually be able to make it in this career field which is very exciting becuase I am loving it so far
