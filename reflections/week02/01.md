## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Where in reference to the code things are, for instance if a variable is on the global scope then you can call it through any function through the page but if it is declared in a function it can't be called after that function and if you use the same name later on on the gloabl scope then it will break that function

2. What is Hoisting ?

you put your variables at the top of your js file to declare it before it is used

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

you would want to use let if you want a constantly changing and or changeable variable and const usually when working with functions so the variable is unchangeable
