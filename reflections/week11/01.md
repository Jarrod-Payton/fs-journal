## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

it allows us to have everything from whatever is being inherited and more

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

it allows us to hide certain things from the inherited class, if it is a private then you can access it with the parent class but not from the class that is inheriting it

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

it allows for better setups where maybe you want everything inherited from a certain class except one thing that needs to stay special to that
