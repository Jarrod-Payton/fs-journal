## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

primary key is what it is sorted by on the table and foregin key refers to something

2. What is an `Alias`?

an alias is when you say SELECT * FROM doctors d the d is the alias here and allows for clearer code as well as easier setup on our end as well as easier understanding

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

string sql = @"
SELECT
d.*,
d.id AS doctorId,
p.*
FROM doctorsRelations dr
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dr.doctorId
JOIN patients p ON p.id = dr.patientId
;";

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsRelations (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
