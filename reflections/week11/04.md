## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been amazing, it has taught me way better than I would have ever dreamed and has shown me what my true passion is, I have definitely had some drama along the way with my Grandmother dying, my Partner breaking up with me, totalling my car, and losing connection to most of my friends all in the time of the course starting (probaobly TMI but this has a point okay) but yet despite these things that have all been pretty significant and would usually cause me to lose my footing as far as learning or having the will to go on, I haven't lost it, I feel more confident than ever in my ability to become a developer and totally rock this career field. I am concerned with finding a job but that is to be expected. I plan on having fun with it, there isn't any kind of final that could scare me at the moment. I am more than confident in my abilities and I can't wait to get started. The thing I have enjoyed most has been the constant learning and honestly my own ability to learn, I was a very very very poor student in High School but in this course I feel I have acceled past the rest of my class and truly understand how the computer sees things (those words will proboably bite me in the but later on but whatever).
