put async in the function head

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

it allows the promises to get resolved before trying other things allowing debugging to work easier as well as set up more line to line code as opposed to trying to hop all over the screen every second trying to catch errors that could be from 5 functions at the same time
