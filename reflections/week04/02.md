## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, Resolved, Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

it allows us to set up a whole lot of different functions that can work simultaniously because information is promised and gets put in whenever the data arrives

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

then works as a resolved and catch is more of a rejection
