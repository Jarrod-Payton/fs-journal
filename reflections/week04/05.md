# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

it all seemed (and not to sound cocky) really freaking easy, once you just find out what to map to where it is really easy

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

honestly nothing really

- What are you struggling with?

CSS is a pain in my booty, I have JavaScript down but CSS is a no no

- What would you count as a victory?

this whole week
