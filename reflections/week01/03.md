## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tip would be to hand pick a color that goes with your background

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I think that for myself I need to rememeber that a bold look can be a lot more professional than a bigger text size look. Another great one is to remeber only to put black letters on white background or white letters on a black background because it makes it impossible to read and incredibly unprofessional if not.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think that the design of ones website is very important becasue it shows a level of proffesionalism as well as a good indicator that it isnt ran by someone with no comprehension of design. It also gives off a more reliable presentation whenever someone is going online to learn about a company which could be great because if not they might not trust you with their money or their address much less their phone number.
