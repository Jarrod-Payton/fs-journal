# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This is honestly the first thing besides gaming that I have found where I do not even slightly resent the time I put into it, I feel as though the teachers are nothing but nice and I have never been more sure of a path that I want to go down than this one I am going down now.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

How Harrison can have such nice hair and such a nice looking hat and still feel the need to lie about his wife. but honestly I am surprised at how well I am able to pick this up.

- What are you struggling with?

I am honestly really confident, I don't feel like I am struggling hardly at all which is a lot better than I expected. Usually I am the kid who is behind and needs tutoring but so far things feel right and I feel as though I am keeping up at a really good pace

- What would you count as a victory?

This class as a whole. I feel like everything is really good for me right now, I feel like I have found my calling and I am on the road to making it become a reality, so this week as a whole is a dub.
