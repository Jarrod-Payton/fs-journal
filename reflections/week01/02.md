## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

a pseudo class is used to give something action like when someone hovers over something it runs a certain styling

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

it is the number that tells css what to apply, it is what gives everything order, for instance if you have a situation where you want a color to be purple but there is something down the sheet that changes it to red and you are too lazy to change the bottom one you increase the specificity of it to make it supreme

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

It would take away the convenience of a well structured css page because it would cause people to use !important again and again until eventually everything is !important because its the only way to get something through and in the wise words of Syndrome (from incredibles) "when everyone is !important (it actually says superhero but thats not important) no one is !important"
