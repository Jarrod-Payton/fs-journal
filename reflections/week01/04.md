## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To make a blueprint of what it is you are going to be coding before getting to the coding part of it

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low Fidelity Wireframes are usually very poorly made and just show a very simple concept of what they are looking for, mid fidelity is usually used to show what a client is looking for with a lot more detail, and a high fidelity can also be used to show how the app actually functions with 3rd party softwares that can show transitions and what not

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely they are, they make coding a lot easier and are nothing but good. It helps with overview and gives you a usually easy format to go off of.
