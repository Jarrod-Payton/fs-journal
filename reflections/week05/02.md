## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one to many, one to one, many to one

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

linking would be better for security purposes in my opinion because you have to know what data is stored and what id they have to access it where as embedding it is just hardcoding it into their profile which makes it so when you grab a person their address it right there

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

a big deciding factor will end up being the size of the application you are using for instance a service with a lot of photos in a social media site, you wouldn't want to embed the posts of the user into the user profile because it might work for the server the front end code will have to include a lot of for each statements in order to keep up with when the page is rendered and the users as well as making searching for a post near impossible

Server end is very much the same thing per controller with slightly different naming
