> **ðŸ“– [Using Query Parameters](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/01-Query-Parameters)**

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

to be able to search by keyword, or aspect

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

a query paramater is a ? and then an aspect of the object so for instance if I had a bunch of posts i wanted to go through then I would put a ?tag=Nature

as far as paramaters go you would want to put that in the url how it is for instance if in my server I have my url set to localhost:3000/api/posts/:id then the url i would put in as a client would look like localhost:3000/api/posts/120394850392847593 to get my specfiic post by id

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

for search by keyword
