1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

giving yourself 2 hours to finish a mechanic in your software or 15 minutes to solve a problem before getting help to maximize efficency

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

I will get a timebox app to try and better keep up with time as well as get something like trello to keep up with where I am and what I need to do as well focusing more heavily on timeboxing as a whole

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

For instance if you are working on a 50 hour project with 10 functinos you might want to set up a timebox for yourself where you only spend 5 hours per function (odviously that specific scenerio wouldn't be super feasable but the idea is there) it is also good for debugging especially as a junior dev you give yourself an hour to solve a problem before asking a senior
