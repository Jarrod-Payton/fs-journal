# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation, Inheritence, Polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let property = staff.name? I don't know if that is what you guys were looking for but thats how I would do it given my understanding of the question (which might be wrong)
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation comes from the ancient language of people smarter than me and it refers to when you use the ancient technique of 12 year olds everywhere to hide information or operations inside a pile of other things to make it an abstract data type and make it harder to find
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a class is the real thing, the default, the originial, whereas the instance is like when you say let x = new class so that it is a copy but isn't being updated
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is an anonomizer which allows you to hide information and functions and arrays while still being able to use them
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It allows for a nice security network as well as common practice as well as a nice way to lighten the load on the computer used by not relying on one file for everything
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the controller is called through the page and and main and it talkes to the service, it is the waiter in the analogy that initially didn't make sense that Mick gave
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the service talks to the AppState to get information
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
If we go back to the analogy it is the recipe it is the construtor used, it is the blueprint to make things and then most likely use them in an array and what not
```
